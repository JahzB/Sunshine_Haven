<h1> Who Am I? </h1>

<p> My name is Jahzara Broaster i am currently a student attending highschool in Belize. I have always grown up around people that didn't have all the luxuries that I had so
I would share my books with them. I got to see the smile on their faces when I would share my books with them. It brough me so much joy to do so  and i wanted to make more
kids smile like that, which is why Sunshine Haven was created.</p>

<h2> <u> Access to Books Is the Key to Successful Reading Development</u> </h2>

<p> Sixty-one percent of low-income families have no books at all in their homes for their
children. While low-income children have, on average, four children’s books in their homes,
a team of researchers concluded that nearly two-thirds of the low-income families they
studied owned no books for their children (US Dept. of Education, 1996).
Children in low-income families lack essential one-on-one reading time. The average
child growing up in a middle-class family has been exposed to 1,000 to 1,700 hours of
one-on-one picture book reading. The average child growing up in a less economically
stable family, in contrast, has only been exposed to 25 hours of one-on-one reading
(McQuillan, 1998).
<br> <br>
The most successful way to improve the reading achievement of low-income children is to
increase their access to print. Communities ranking high in achievement tests have several
factors in common: an abundance of books in public libraries, easy access to books in the
community at large, and a large number of textbooks per student (Newman et al., 2000).
The only behavior measure that correlates significantly with reading scores is the
number of books in the home. An analysis of a national data set of nearly 100,000 United
States school children found that access to printed materials—and not poverty—is the
“critical variable affecting reading acquisition” (McQuillan, 1998) </p>

<h2><u> What are the Effects of Reading on Child Development?</u> </h2>
<p> Numerous pieces of research conducted and commissioned by BookTrust have discovered the profound
   benefits of reading for a child’s development. One study details the effects of reading on later literacy
   skills, facilitating social interaction between adults and children, and encouraging children to engage with
   the world around them. It also states how reading can be a ‘stable source of information’ throughout a child’s life.
   This stability allows them to access text in a constant fashion and can be especially beneficial for children growing up
   in challenging circumstances.</p>
